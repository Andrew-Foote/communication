This is a script which implements a simple model of communication where entities attempt to communicate meanings to each other by signalling. Each entity has the capability to map meanings to signals, when producing a signal, or signals to meanings, when receiving a signal. Communications are not always successful as the signal might be interpreted as having a different meaning from the one that the producer intended.

The script contains classes that can be used to represent these communicating entities, with methods that can be used to calculate the probability of success for a given communication. Additionally there is a function (test_success_formula) which tests that this calculation actually works, by doing lots of communications, calculating the rate of success and plotting a graph so that the user can assess the accuracy.
